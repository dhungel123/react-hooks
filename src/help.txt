difference between var, let and const

var-->if we decleare a variable from var,
 then we can aslo declare it again with the same name,
  and if we want to re-assign its value
   then we can do that too..

let-->if we declare a variable with let,
 then we cannot seclare it again with the same name
  but can re-assign its value.

const--> And if we declare variable with const,
 then we can neither declare it again,
  nor can re-assign its value.

  ************Map vs Filter in Array*****************
The map method is used to transform each item of an array,
 while the filter method is used to select certain items of an array 
 that meet a condition12. 

 For example:
// map example: double each number in the array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8]

// filter example: keep only even numbers in the array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let even = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]



***************Hooks****************
starts with 'use' (both react and custom hooks)
components must be upperCase
hooks always invoke inside function/component body
don't call hooks conditionally(if vitra lekhna mildaina)
set functions don't update state immediately
